## Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

### Description:
Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade according to the following criteria:

- A: Greater than 79
- B: 60 to 79
- C: 49 to 59
- D: 40 to 49
- E: Less than 40

## Challenge 2: Speed Detector

### Description:
Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car (e.g., 80). If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver accumulates more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

## Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator

### Description:
Write a program to calculate an individual’s net salary by inputting their basic salary and benefits. Calculate the PAYE (Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary using the tax rates and calculations provided by the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) and other relevant institutions.
